-An Array is a collection of values of the same data type(homogenous collection of values)

-Features of an Array
:An array declaration allocates sequential memory blocks
:Arrays are static. Once arrays are initialized they cannot be resized
:Each memory block represents an array element
:Array elements are identified by an unique integer called the subscript/index of the element
:Populating the array elements is known as initialization
:Array element values can be updated or modified but cannot be deleted

Create an array In Rust:
-An array is created using the [] brackets, and separate the values using a comma
-Elements of the array should be of the same data type
let array = [element1, element2, element3, element4, element5];


To declare and initialize an array in Rust:
i)let variable_name = [value1, value2, value3]; //the type of array is inferred from the data type  of the array elements
//during initialization

ii)let variable_name:[dataType; size] = [value1, value2, value3];

iii)let variable_name:[dataType; size] = [default_value_for_elements, size];

Access Array Elements
-To access an array element, refer to its index
Array indices start from 0: [0] is the first element

let array = [element1, element2, element3, element4, element5];
println!("The first element is: {}", array[0])


Change array Values
To change the value of a specified element, refer to the index number and assign a new value
-The array must be mutable
let mut array =  [element1, element2, element3, element3, element4, element5];
array[0] = value;
println!("The new value is {}", array[0]);


Array Length
-To obtain the number of elements in the array, use the len() method
let array = [element1, element2, element3, element4, element5];
println!("This array has {} elements.", array.len());

Display all elements in an array
-To Display all the elements inside an array:
use: println!("{:?}", array);

To print an element from an array:
use: println!("{}", array[0]);

Note; variables cannot be used to define the size of the array
Example;
fn main(){
   let N: usize = 100;
   let arr = [0; N]; //error non constant used with constant
   print!("{}", arr[10]);
}

//the compiler results in an exception, since the length of the array must be known at compile time
the value of the variable N will be determined at runtime
