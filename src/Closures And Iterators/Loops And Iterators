=To determine whether to use loops or iterators one needs to know which implementation
is faster
=Iterators although a high level abstraction get compiled down to roughly the same code
as the lower level
=Iterators are one of Rust's zero cost abstraction, by which it means that using the abstraction imposes
no additional runtime overhead
=Unrolling is an optimization that removes the overhead of the loop controlling code and instead generates repetitive
code for each iteration of the loop

NOTE: The env::args function returns an iterator of type std::env::Args, , and it implements an Iterator trait and returns String
values
There is passing of ownership of the iterator returned returned from env::args to Config::build directly
