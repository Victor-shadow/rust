-In Rust idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes and the comment continues
until the end of the line
-For comments that extend beyond a single line, you include '//'  on each line

//Rust is a statically typed programming language
//It is memory safe, concurrent language
-Comments can also be placed at the end of lines of containing code
fn main(){
   let output = "Rust Language"; //it is system-level programming language
}
